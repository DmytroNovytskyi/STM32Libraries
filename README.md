## Description

A set of simple STM32 libraries I use in my projects. Each folder contains configuration guide for STM32CubeIDE.

## Available Libraries

- PWM Library — A utility for managing PWM signals with timers, allowing frequency and duty cycle adjustment.

- KY-023 Library — A library for interfacing with the KY-023 joystick module, allowing reading of X and Y axis values and joystick switch state using ADC channels.

- NRF24L01 Library — A library for working with the nRF24L01+ module, enabling communication and data exchange between devices using the NRF24L01+ transceiver.
