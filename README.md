## Description

A set of simple STM32 libraries I use in my own projects. Each folder contains documentation and resources for integration.

## Available Libraries

- **ADC Library** - Provides functionality for performing Analog-to-Digital Conversions (ADC) on STM32 microcontrollers, allowing measurement of analog input voltages.

- **AT24Cxx Library** - Simplifies interaction with AT24Cxx series EEPROM chips via the I2C protocol. It supports reading and writing single bytes, as well as efficient multi-byte operations with automatic page boundary handling. Includes a full memory erase function.

- **KY-023 Library** - Manages the KY-023 joystick module, allows reading of X and Y axis values and joystick switch state using ADC channels.

- **KY-040 Library** - Manages the KY-040 rotary encoder, allowing reading of rotational changes (steps and direction) and the state of the integrated push-button.

- **NRF24L01 Library** - Manages the nRF24L01+ module, enables communication and data exchange between devices using the NRF24L01+ transceiver.

- **PWM Library** - Allows working with PWM signals, allowing frequency and duty cycle adjustment.

- **Polynomial Library** - Assists in the creation and manipulation of polynomials, providing functions for fitting polynomials to data points and calculating deviations.

- **SSD1306 Library** - Provides a driver for controlling SSD1306-based OLED displays via I2C. Includes functions for initialization, drawing various shapes, text, and bitmaps.
